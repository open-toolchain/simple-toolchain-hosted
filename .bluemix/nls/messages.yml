template.name: "Develop a Cloud Foundry app"
template.description: "With this toolchain, you can develop and deploy a Cloud Foundry application. By default, the toolchain clones a sample Node.js “Hello World” app into an IBM hosted Git repo, which you can then modify.  This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery, source control, issue tracking, and online editing.\n\nThe toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service.  If an instance of that service isn’t already in the selected resource group or organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, follow the [classic-tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/introduce-develop-cloud-foundry-app-toolchain) or [tekton-tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/tutorials/introduce-tekton-pipelines-by-using-cloud-foundry-app-toolchain) ."
